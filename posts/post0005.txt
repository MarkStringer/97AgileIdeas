Stand up
This might be a stretch (pun intended), but I think these two books are relevant when you try to explain why stand ups are so effective. 

Dancing in the Streets: A History of Collective Joy by Barbara Ehrenreich (https://amzn.to/41CKcXx)

Keeping Together in Time: William H. McNeill (https://amzn.to/3mZlmCj)
As a team, you all stand up, you move to a different part of the office. This is something that is lost with the advent of remote working, and I’m not sure how to get it back. For me, if someone has a problem with attending stand ups, or when we are in the office environment, doesn’t want to stand up, it’s a warning sign.
