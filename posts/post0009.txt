Working Software

“Working software over comprehensive documentation.”

The Agile manifest is 68 words long.

Five of them are dedicated to working software.

Why? My guess is that some, probably most, of the people who drafted the manifesto had struggled.

They'd struggled to explain to their clients why writing a “comprehensive” specification wasn’t the recipe for software success.

A big part of the problem is in that word. “Comprehensive.”

How do you know that the specification is “comprehensive?”

The answer is that you don’t.

You’ve got to guess. You have to hope.

Or you could start implementing that spec.

Then run it. Show it. Publish it.
