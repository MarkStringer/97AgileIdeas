Working software
“Sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Arthur C Clarke

Working software is magic. A specification document isn’t.

People will respond to working software in a completely differently than they do to a spec. 

Working software makes things obvious. It makes demands.

When users see it, they’ll want more. They’ll want different things. Someone has to decide if they should get them.

"This is slow."

“I need a share button here.”

“I need a report of everything that just happened.”

This is a power shift. From the people who initiated the product, to the people who consume it. From the dream to the reality.
