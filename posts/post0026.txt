Stories

What should you capture in the stories? What the team needs to capture in the stories.

Does that mean all the INVEST criteria need to be met?

Independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, sized (small?), testable?

I’ve got to say, probably not.

Does it mean that every story needs to be in the “As an X, I can Y so that Z” format?

No.
Does it mean that every story has to have been closely examined by a three amigos meeting?

Guess what? No again.
What about acceptance criteria?
What about conditions of satisfaction?
All these things are good ideas. Try them. Inspect and adapt.
