I had an idea for a book "97 Agile Ideas." Every week I would talk about an agile idea. After slightly less than two years I would have a book. I would try to post at least 100 words most days. That would be a page a week. with a bit of an intro, and a bit of an outro, that would then constitute a book.

The question of course is - can I keep up that kind of consistency? The answer is, probably not. But we can give it a go can't we. And see. First topic? Stand ups.
