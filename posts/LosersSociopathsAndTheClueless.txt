The "Gervais" principle: Losers, sociopaths and the clueless

This is an idea developed by the writer and thinker Venkatesh Rao. It's his reading of what's going on in the sitcom "The Office" written by Ricky Gervaise.

Like some of the best and most true ideas. This starts as a joke, actually a cartoon. 

The cartoon shows a pyramid. It is divided into three layers. The bottom of the pyramid is labelled "Losers."

The top of the pyramid is labelled "Sociopaths" and the middle of the pyramid is labelled "Clueless."

The whole pyramid is labelled "The struture of the an organisation."


The "Gervais"principle: Losers

Why are the people are the bottom of the pyramid called losers? 

They're called losers because they are making a bad deal. 

They aren't using their skills to make all the money that they possibly could.

They aren't taking as many risks as they could. 

So they aren't reaping the rewards that they could. 

They're using their skills to look for a quite life. 

But obviously they don't think of themselves as losers.
