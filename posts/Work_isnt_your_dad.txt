Today's Agile idea is that work “isn't your dad.”
What do I mean by that? I mean that work doesn’t necessarily have your best interests at heart. In many work environments that I’ve been in, work doesn’t even have its OWN best interests at heart. Work isn’t concerned with your well-being and development. Also, you shouldn’t look to work for moral guidance. 
This was an important realisation for me. Because for a long time in my work environment, especially through my 20’s and 30’s, I would get annoyed because work didn’t seem to be looking out for me.
Now, some people I know have said, “Work is exactly like my dad, it’s feckless, overbearing and abusive.” OK so, work isn’t an ideal parent. And the difference between work and your dad, is that you are, to some degree entitled to expect some of that ideal parent from your actual parents. I don’t think you should expect it *at all* from work. 
So, here's how I'm approaching the 97 agile ideas posts just now. I'm randomly selecting one of the 
ideas from the 97 agile ideas file. You can see here online.
