Stand up

If you’re the Scrum master, I think it’s your job to make sure the stand ups happen. And it’s good if they happen at the same time, in the same (real or virtual) place every day. And it’s also your job to stop them going off track. I try to keep mine to 15 minutes. I try to keep conversations about cat illness, current events and football to a minimum. If there are any genuine, longer conversations that have bubbled up that need to be had amongst the team, I call them out and arrange a time for them.
