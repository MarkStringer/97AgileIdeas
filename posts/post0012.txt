Working software
“Showing working software to users is a power shift.”

If I’m a Scrum master on a project, I’m not just there to be a facilitator. I’m there to advocate for working software. This means that I look like a troublemaker. I’m pushing for that power shift from senior people in the organisation to users. I’m pushing to move the team and its sponsors into an unstable situation.

It also means I look like I’m an idiot. Who looks for trouble? Wouldn’t it be safer for all concerned if we just didn’t show the software to the users?

Well in the short term, yes.

But in the long term, no.
