Working software
“Why don’t we wait another couple of weeks until we’ve got this bit right. Why don’t wait until we’ve got the whole of this journey?”

Why? Because you might have got it wrong.

The users telling you that you’ve got it wrong?

That’s embarrassing.

Embarrassing for the people who pushed for the project. They used their influence to get this project funded.

Embarrassing for the people who funded the project. They funded it!

Maybe it doesn’t work at all, doesn’t work as expected? That’s embarrassing for developers.

Maybe it doesn’t look great yet. That’s embarrassing for designers.

Are you doing what's good for the project or for the product? Or are you avoiding embarrassment?
