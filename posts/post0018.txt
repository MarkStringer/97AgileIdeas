Bricks without straw

Is there a bricks without straw problem on your project? If there is, that's the thing that you should be focusing on fixing.

Not the meandering stand up.

Not the acceptance criteria on the stories in the backlog.

Nothing, but nothing to do with story points or velocity.

If there's something that's wrong, like a bricks without straw problem, that means the project is never going to succeed unless it's fixed. Never.

That's the thing that you have call out and get fixed.

The great sage and fellow former Highgate resident Jerry Springer might have said (it's in the opera)
"I don't solve people's problems, I televise them."

That's your job now. Do you have a risk register? Are you reporting on it and reviewing it at least every two weeks? Are you making it clear what is the limiting factor on the speed of development?
