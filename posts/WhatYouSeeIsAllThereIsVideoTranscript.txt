So here's today's Agile Idea

What you see is all there is

This is an idea that comes from Daniel Kahneman

And the point that he's making is that

We only think about the things that we're aware of

We don't think about the things that we aren't aware of

That might seem really obvious

The complication when it comes to Agile and project managment

Is and this sounds

like really weird, but it's true

Some of the things that people see

Aren't there!

So, especially with

Erm

The idea of the project

The kind of finished product

Obviously when the project's being worked on

The finished product isn't there

But erm

Some people, especially the people who

Were heavily invested in kicking the idea off

They can already see that

And so one of the things

That you're doing

When you're doing project management

Is trying to show them other things

Trying to show them difficulties

Trying to show them decisions that they need to make

To make this thing that they can already see, happen
