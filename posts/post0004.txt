Stand up

They took pigs and chickens out of the Scrum guide, but chickens are real. They happen https://lnkd.in/dDrPJDYG.  Every now and then someone senior will want to drift by and attend your stand up. There’s nothing much you can do about this. If it gets to be a regular thing, it needs addressing.

People outside of the team shouldn’t be attending the stand-up regularly. This is where the team can share fears, failures and frustrations. They’re not going to do that if the big bosses are watching. Should the product owner come every day? Yes. If you don’t feel comfortable with the PO at your stand ups, you’ve got bigger problems.
