What’s great about a standup is that if you have a team, you can have a stand up right now. That’s the thing about stand-ups. This might be Scrum’s secret to success. No complex methodology required. You can start. Just start. Then you can start adapting. Wrong slot? Find a different one. People not saying enough? People saying too much? Fix it as a team. All the rules and norms are going to be different now after the virus, but standing up is important. The actual act of standing up is good. It’s doing something different. It's breaking the routine.
