Stand up
Stand up is about facilitating empirical process. “Empirical” comes from the Greek word “εμπειρία” (“embiria”) which means “experience.” Empirical process has three key elements.

Transparency - being able to see the world.
Inspection - looking at it.
Adaptation - changing what we do in light of what we see.

When a team stands up and gives itself the chance to talk about what they’re doing and how things are going, they’re doing inspection and transparency.

When they change what they do because of what they hear, then they’re adapting. The stand up is the most basic way of experiencing a project.
