Yesterday I talked about the idea of work not being your dad. 

And I think it's important to understand this. Work doesn't have your best interests at heart, and unlike you dad, you don't have any right to expect it to.

But that does then raise the question of what work is.

When I thought about this again, just recently, I was reminded of this quotation from Joseph Conrad:

>> I don't like work - no man does - but I like what is in the work - the chance to find yourself. Your own reality - for yourself not for others - what no other man can ever know. They can only see the mere show, and never can tell what it really means.

This sounds about right to me. 

Work gives me chance to play on a bigger stage. It gives me chance to work with people who are much clever than me and so get things done that I'd never manage on my own. It also of course, feeds and clothes me.

But realising that work isn't your dad, also connects with some other Agile ideas. The idea from Taiichi Ohno, of "What is it?" What is the job really? What is it really that you're trying to do? And also, the idea of Agile as a way of liberation. Agile as a way of allowing you to get involved in work that you couldn't and shouldn't possibly be involving yourself with, if you were still thinking that work is like a parent.
