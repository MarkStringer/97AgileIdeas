 Stories.

Here's another contradiction relating to stories, or perhaps a couple.

The more detailed the story, the more likely it is to be wrong.

The more detailed the story, the more likely it is to go out of date. Before the development team gets around to planning it, the world may have changed.

The world does change.

Deciding how detailed stories need to be before they can be planned and implemented? Determining how many of the prioritised stories should have detailed work done on them?

None of this can truly be decided outside of a project. It must be calibrated once the project begins.

So, regardless of the stance you take at the beginning, you and your team will likely end up making changes.
