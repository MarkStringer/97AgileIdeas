"Bricks without Straw"

If you're interested in scaling Agile across your development teams, you should be keenly aware of any "bricks without straw" problems.

A situation only becomes a "bricks without straw" problem if the team can't solve it themselves, and attempts to escalate the issue have failed. This indicates that it's likely a problem occurring at an institutional level.

Is there no way of allocating time for front-line staff to collaborate with user researchers without detracting from their primary tasks? Are development servers, test servers, and live servers not included in the project budget?

These are "bricks without straw" problems, and they can only be resolved at an organizational level. And they can be solved at that level, making scaling Agile a much more likely prospect.
