Stories

As I'm writing about stories, I realize that I've stumbled across a contradiction.

Managing software development is filled with contradictions, and if you don't have contact with them, you probably should.

Managing contradictions is definitely an agile idea. It might be THE agile idea.

What's the contradiction when it comes to stories? It's really all about the conversation, but you also need somebody who's willing to write things down.

Not everything that has been said, but the essence and spirit of whatâ€™s been said.

In my experience, most developers don't want to write things. Product owners don't want to write things either. The ones that can and do it well are treasures.

What you need is somebody who's willing to write to try to capture the conversations that have been had, not in a super detailed way, but in a way that captures the essence without the need to dot every 'i' and cross every 't'.

You might call that person a BA. You might call them a content designer. But they have to be a writer.
